The current approach to attempt to solve this problem is to *square* each of the differences from the value to the mean and sum these squared differences, such that the signage becomes uniform. This solves the signage problem, but in my opinion creates a different problem wherein it increases the weights of increasingly greater residuals. I am intuitively led to believe that actually the relative inverse of this should be going on; increasingly small residuals should receive greater adjusted weights and increasingly large residuals should receive lower adjusted weights (so perhaps the sum of the logarithm of each absolute residual). But I (partially) digress...\n",
